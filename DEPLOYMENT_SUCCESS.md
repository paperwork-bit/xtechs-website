## ✅ What's Working Now

1. **Your site is live** at the deployment URL above
2. **Environment variables** are set in Cloudflare Pages
3. **Deployment completed successfully**

---

## 🔧 Next Steps

### Option 1: Use the Deployment URL (Temporary)

For now, you can:
- Use the deployment URL: `https://2f722b5d.xtechs-website.pages.dev`
- Share this URL for testing
- This URL will always work while the deployment exists

### Option 2: Set Up Production URL

To make `xtechs-website.pages.dev` work (without the deployment ID):

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → xtechs-website
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Check **Production branch** setting:
   - Should be set to `main` or `master`
   - If not, set it and save
4. Go to **Deployments** tab
5. Find your latest successful deployment
6. Click the **"..."** menu (three dots)
7. Look for **"Promote to production"** or **"Set as production"**
8. Click it to make this deployment the production one

After this, `https://xtechs-website.pages.dev` should work!

### Option 3: Set Up Custom Domain (Recommended)

To use `https://xtechsrenewables.com.au`:

1. **First, test that the deployment URL works:**
   - Visit: https://2f722b5d.xtechs-website.pages.dev
   - Make sure everything looks good

2. **Add custom domain:**
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → xtechs-website
   - Click **Custom domains** tab
   - Click **"Set up a custom domain"**
   - Enter: `xtechsrenewables.com.au`
   - Click **Continue** or **Add domain**

3. **Configure DNS:**
   - If domain is on Cloudflare: DNS is configured automatically
   - If domain is elsewhere: Add CNAME record pointing to `xtechs-website.pages.dev`
   - Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation

4. **Wait for SSL:**
   - Cloudflare will automatically issue SSL certificate
   - Usually takes 5-15 minutes
